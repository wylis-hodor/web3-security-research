# Web3 Security Research

This repository is my **audit portfolio** â€” a collection of smart contract security research, confirmed bug reports, proof-of-concepts, and methodology.  
It demonstrates my hands-on approach to finding vulnerabilities in DeFi protocols, staking systems, and Web3 infrastructure.

## âœ… Highlights

- **Confirmed Findings**  
  Vulnerabilities reported and accepted on platforms such as Immunefi.  
  Includes PoCs, traces, and root cause analysis.  

- **Active Cantina Participation**  
  Currently participating in Cantina audit (Sept 2025, Octant).  
  Findings and sanitized writeups will be added here once confirmed.  

- **Coursework & Exercises**  
  Selected exercises from Cyfrin Updraft and other training programs.  
  Includes both guided and independent discoveries.
  Go For C++ Devs

- **Methodology**  
  My audit checklist: CEI/reentrancy, approvals/allowances, ERC20 assumptions, dust/native asset handling, batch loops, signature validation, and more.  
  Custom helper scripts and Bash tools for source and bytecode scanning.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal

This portfolio is meant to show:

- **Technical depth** â€” I build working PoCs and Foundry tests for every finding.  
- **Breadth of coverage** â€” From staking logic and accounting drift to ERC20 approvals and dust handling.  
- **Consistency** â€” A systematic approach that can scale across protocols.
