# Title

Implementation contract AlchemistV3 not locked (_disableInitializers() missing)

## Brief/Intro
`AlchemistV3` is designed for use behind a proxy (tests deploy a `TransparentUpgradeableProxy` and call `initialize(...)` via the proxy). The implementation contract uses `constructor() initializer {}` instead of calling `_disableInitializers()` in its constructor. While not exploitable today, this is a known upgrade security issue and a deviation from current OpenZeppelin best practice.

## Vulnerability Details
OpenZeppelin’s initialization system uses a version number. Each initializer/reinitializer consumes a version so it can’t be run again. The docs say: “The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be reused.”

Conventionally, the `initializer` modifier is the first step and is treated as version 1. Therefore, `initializer` is effectively equivalent to `reinitializer(1)`. Subsequent upgrades use `reinitializer(2), reinitializer(3)`, etc.  Function call `_disableInitializers()` sets the internal “initialized version” to a terminal state so no `initializer` or any future `reinitializer(n)` can ever run on that specific contract instance (the implementation).  OpenZeppelin recommends calling it in the implementation’s constructor for proxy-based systems.

## Impact Details
This is an Insight for Security best practice (implementation not hard-locked; increased risk of accidental initialization/reinitialization on the implementation address in future versions).

"Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.
An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation contract, which may impact the proxy. To prevent the implementation contract from being used, you should invoke the Initializable._disableInitializers function in the constructor to automatically lock it."
