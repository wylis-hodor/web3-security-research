1. gas optimized fixed-point math library with 3 funcs


will learn this on sqrt:
1. the hard way with formal verification
   1. Halmos
   2. Certora
1b. sqrt
2. the hint that should have tipped you off before doing that

4 stages of invariant tests:
1. stateless fuzz
2. stateful fuzz
3. stateful fuzz with preconditions (handler)
4. formal verification
